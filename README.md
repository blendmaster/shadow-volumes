# Shadow Volumes

A pretty vanilla implementation of shadow volumes in openGL 3.3,
done for CSCI 544 Advanced Computer Graphics Spring 2014, at th
Colorado School of Mines, Project 2.

Models that work with the viewer code can be found at TODO.
My professor has all the models as `.t` files. I'll upload
them somewhere after I'm done.
